# GraphCommerce, Magento 2, and Next.js Integration Guide

## Overview

This document explains how GraphCommerce works with Magento 2 and Next.js, with
a particular focus on GraphQL queries and data fetching. It provides insights
into the architecture, query structure, and best practices for extending the
default functionality.

## Architecture

GraphCommerce is a headless commerce framework that combines:

- **Next.js**: For the frontend React framework and server-side rendering
- **GraphQL**: For efficient data fetching from Magento 2
- **Magento 2**: As the backend e-commerce platform

The architecture follows these principles:

1. **Headless**: Completely separates the frontend from the backend
2. **API-first**: All communication happens through GraphQL APIs
3. **Composable**: Built with modular components that can be customized
4. **Performance-focused**: Optimized for speed with SSR, ISR, and client-side
   caching

## GraphQL in GraphCommerce

### Query Structure

GraphCommerce uses a fragment-based approach to GraphQL queries:

1. **Base Fragments**: Define the core fields needed for each entity type
2. **Component Fragments**: Define the fields needed by specific UI components
3. **Page Queries**: Combine fragments to fetch all data needed for a page

Example of a typical query structure:

```graphql
query ProductPage2($urlKey: String!) {
  products(filter: { url_key: { eq: $urlKey } }) {
    ...ProductSpecs2
    items {
      __typename
      uid
      ...ProductPageItem
      # Other fragments
    }
  }
}
```

### Fragment Composition

Fragments are composed hierarchically:

- `ProductPageItem` might include `ProductShortDescription`
- `ProductShortDescription` includes the `short_description` field
- This creates a tree of dependencies that GraphCommerce resolves

### Extending Queries

To extend queries with additional fields:

1. **Create a custom fragment** with a unique name (avoid overriding existing
   fragments)
2. **Include the fields** you need in your custom fragment
3. **Add your fragment** to the existing query

Example:

```graphql
# Custom fragment
fragment CustomProductListItems on Products {
  items {
    __typename
    uid
    ...ProductListItem
    short_description {
      html
    }
  }
}

# Modified query
query ProductList2(...) {
  products(...) {
    ...ProductListItems
    ...CustomProductListItems  # Add your custom fragment
  }
}
```

## Data Flow in GraphCommerce

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

1. **getStaticProps/getServerSideProps**: Fetch data on the server
2. **graphqlSsrClient**: Client configured for server-side requests
3. **Data Hydration**: Initial data is sent to the client with the HTML

### Client-Side Data Fetching

1. **useQuery/useLazyQuery**: Apollo hooks for client-side data fetching
2. **Caching**: Results are cached in Apollo Client's store
3. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates before server confirmation

## TypeScript Integration

GraphCommerce generates TypeScript types from GraphQL schemas:

1. **Codegen**: Automatically generates types from GraphQL schemas and
   operations
2. **Type Safety**: Components receive strongly-typed props based on GraphQL
   fragments
3. **Fragment Masking**: Ensures components only access fields they explicitly
   request

## Common Customization Patterns

### Adding Fields to Queries

As demonstrated with the product description:

1. Create a custom fragment with the additional fields
2. Add the fragment to the existing query
3. Use TypeScript annotations if needed (`@ts-expect-error`) when types aren't
   automatically updated

### Creating Custom Components

1. Create a component that accepts the data structure from your custom fragment
2. Use the data in your component with proper TypeScript typing
3. Replace or extend existing components in the page structure

### Modifying Existing Components

1. Import and extend the original component
2. Override specific methods or properties
3. Use the modified component in place of the original

## Best Practices

1. **Never modify core fragments**: Create custom fragments instead
2. **Use meaningful fragment names**: Avoid conflicts with existing fragments
3. **Keep fragments focused**: Each fragment should serve a specific purpose
4. **Minimize query duplication**: Reuse fragments across queries
5. **Consider performance**: Only request the fields you need
6. **Run codegen after changes**: Keep TypeScript types in sync with GraphQL
   schema

## Debugging Tips

1. **Apollo DevTools**: Inspect queries, cache, and responses
2. **GraphQL Playground**: Test queries against your Magento instance
3. **TypeScript Errors**: Often indicate mismatches between queries and
   components
4. **Network Tab**: Check actual GraphQL requests and responses

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Multiple Fragment Definitions

**Problem**: Error "Multiple definitions of the same fragment found"

**Solution**:

- Rename your custom fragment to avoid conflicts
- Use a unique prefix for your project's fragments

### Missing Fields in TypeScript

**Problem**: TypeScript errors about missing fields that you added in GraphQL

**Solution**:

- Run `yarn codegen` to update TypeScript types
- Use `@ts-expect-error` as a temporary solution
- Ensure your fragment is included in the query

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow page loads due to large queries

**Solution**:

- Only request fields you need
- Use pagination for large collections
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Conclusion

GraphCommerce provides a powerful framework for building high-performance
e-commerce storefronts with Magento 2 and Next.js. Understanding the GraphQL
query structure and fragment composition is key to successfully extending and
customizing your implementation.

By following the patterns and best practices outlined in this document, you can
efficiently add new features while maintaining type safety and performance.
