# Advanced Git Features

Beyond the basic Git commands, there are several advanced features that can help you solve complex problems, manage dependencies, and improve your workflow.

## Git Bisect

Git bisect is a powerful debugging tool that helps you find which commit introduced a bug using binary search.

### Basic Bisect Workflow

```bash
# Start the bisect process
git bisect start

# Mark the current commit as bad (has the bug)
git bisect bad

# Mark a known good commit (doesn't have the bug)
git bisect good a1b2c3d4

# Git will checkout a commit halfway between good and bad
# Test this commit and mark it
git bisect good  # or git bisect bad

# Continue until Git finds the first bad commit
# Git will tell you which commit introduced the bug

# End the bisect process
git bisect reset
```

### Automated Bisect

You can automate the process with a test script:

```bash
# Start bisect with a script
git bisect start HEAD a1b2c3d4
git bisect run ./test-script.sh
```

The script should return 0 for good commits and non-zero for bad commits.

### Example: Finding a Performance Regression

```bash
# Start bisect
git bisect start

# Current version is slow
git bisect bad

# Last release was fast
git bisect good v1.0.0

# For each commit Git checks out
# Run performance test
./performance-test.sh

# Mark based on results
git bisect good  # or git bisect bad

# When found, examine the commit
git show COMMIT_HASH

# End bisect
git bisect reset
```

## Git Submodules

Submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your repository, keeping their histories separate.

### Adding a Submodule

```bash
# Add a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/username/repo.git path/to/submodule

# This creates a .gitmodules file and adds the submodule directory
```

### Cloning a Repository with Submodules

```bash
# Clone with submodules in one command
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Or initialize submodules after cloning
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Updating Submodules

```bash
# Update all submodules to their latest commits
git submodule update --remote

# Update a specific submodule
git submodule update --remote path/to/submodule
```

### Working with Submodules

```bash
# Go into the submodule directory
cd path/to/submodule

# It's a normal Git repository
git checkout main
git pull

# Go back to the parent repository
cd -

# Commit the submodule changes
git add path/to/submodule
git commit -m "Update submodule to latest version"
```

### Removing a Submodule

```bash
# Remove the submodule entry from .git/config
git submodule deinit -f path/to/submodule

# Remove the submodule from the working tree and index
git rm -f path/to/submodule

# Remove the submodule directory from .git/modules
rm -rf .git/modules/path/to/submodule

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Remove submodule"
```

## Git Subtrees

Subtrees are an alternative to submodules that embed the entire history of another repository within yours.

### Adding a Subtree

```bash
# Add a subtree
git subtree add --prefix=path/to/subtree https://github.com/username/repo.git main --squash
```

The `--squash` flag combines all commits from the subtree into one.

### Updating a Subtree

```bash
# Pull changes from the subtree's repository
git subtree pull --prefix=path/to/subtree https://github.com/username/repo.git main --squash
```

### Contributing Back to a Subtree

```bash
# Push changes back to the subtree's repository
git subtree push --prefix=path/to/subtree https://github.com/username/repo.git main
```

### Subtrees vs. Submodules

- **Subtrees**: Embed the entire code and history within your repository
- **Submodules**: Reference a specific commit of another repository

Choose subtrees when:

- You want to modify the dependency code alongside your project
- You want users to get all code without additional steps

Choose submodules when:

- You want to keep the dependency separate and at a specific version
- The dependency is large and you don't want to include its entire history

## Git Worktrees

Worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches simultaneously in different directories.

### Creating a Worktree

```bash
# Create a new worktree for a branch
git worktree add ../project-feature feature-branch

# Create a new branch in a new worktree
git worktree add -b new-feature ../project-new-feature
```

### Listing Worktrees

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list
```

### Removing a Worktree

```bash
# Remove a worktree
git worktree remove ../project-feature

# Prune worktrees with deleted directories
git worktree prune
```

### Use Cases for Worktrees

- Working on multiple branches simultaneously
- Building and testing different versions
- Quick context switching without stashing changes

## Git Reflog

The reflog records all changes to branch tips and other references, providing a safety net for recovering lost commits.

### Viewing the Reflog

```bash
# View the reflog
git reflog

# View the reflog for a specific branch
git reflog show feature-branch
```

### Recovering Lost Commits

```bash
# Find the lost commit in the reflog
git reflog

# Create a new branch pointing to the lost commit
git branch recovered-branch HEAD@{2}

# Or reset your current branch to the lost commit
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

### Recovering After a Bad Rebase or Reset

```bash
# View the reflog to find the commit before the rebase/reset
git reflog

# Example output:
# a1b2c3d HEAD@{0}: rebase finished: returning to refs/heads/main
# e4f5g6h HEAD@{1}: rebase: checkout target-branch
# i7j8k9l HEAD@{2}: commit: Last commit before rebase

# Reset to the state before the rebase
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

## Git Filter-Branch and Filter-Repo

These tools allow you to rewrite Git history, useful for removing sensitive data or restructuring repositories.

### Warning

Rewriting history is dangerous and should be avoided on shared branches. Always make a backup before using these commands.

### Using Filter-Branch (Legacy)

```bash
# Remove a file from all commits
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/sensitive-file" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### Using Filter-Repo (Recommended)

First, install `git-filter-repo`:

```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
```

Then use it:

```bash
# Remove a file from history
git filter-repo --path path/to/sensitive-file --invert-paths

# Move everything into a subdirectory
git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter new-root-dir
```

## Git Notes

Git notes allow you to add metadata to commits without changing their SHA-1 hashes.

### Adding Notes

```bash
# Add a note to the current commit
git notes add -m "This commit fixes CVE-2023-12345"

# Add a note to a specific commit
git notes add -m "Reviewed by Alice" a1b2c3d4
```

### Viewing Notes

```bash
# Show notes with commits
git log --show-notes

# Show notes for a specific commit
git notes show a1b2c3d4
```

### Pushing and Pulling Notes

```bash
# Push notes to a remote
git push origin refs/notes/*

# Pull notes from a remote
git fetch origin refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Finding a Bug with Bisect

```bash
# Start bisect
git bisect start

# Current version has the bug
git bisect bad

# Version 1.0.0 didn't have the bug
git bisect good v1.0.0

# Create a test script (test.sh)
echo '#!/bin/sh
./app --test
exit $?
' > test.sh
chmod +x test.sh

# Run bisect with the test script
git bisect run ./test.sh

# Examine the first bad commit
git show bisect/bad

# Reset when done
git bisect reset
```

### Example 2: Managing a Project with Dependencies as Submodules

```bash
# Add libraries as submodules
git submodule add https://github.com/org/lib1.git libs/lib1
git submodule add https://github.com/org/lib2.git libs/lib2

# Commit the additions
git commit -m "Add lib1 and lib2 as submodules"

# Later, update the libraries
git submodule update --remote
git commit -am "Update libraries to latest versions"

# Create a script to help team members
echo '#!/bin/sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
' > update-deps.sh
chmod +x update-deps.sh
```

### Example 3: Using Worktrees for Parallel Development

```bash
# Create worktrees for different versions
git worktree add ../project-main main
git worktree add ../project-dev develop
git worktree add -b hotfix ../project-hotfix

# Work on each version in its own directory
cd ../project-main
# Work on main...

cd ../project-dev
# Work on develop...

cd ../project-hotfix
# Work on hotfix...

# List all worktrees
git worktree list
```

### Example 4: Recovering from a Mistaken Force-Push

```bash
# Someone force-pushed and overwrote your commits
git fetch

# Find your lost commits in the reflog
git reflog

# Create a branch with your original work
git branch recovered-work HEAD@{5}

# Create a new branch that incorporates both sets of changes
git checkout -b merged-work
git merge recovered-work

# Resolve any conflicts and push
git push -u origin merged-work
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use bisect for debugging** when you know a bug was introduced recently
2. **Consider alternatives to submodules** like package managers when appropriate
3. **Make backups before rewriting history** with filter-branch or filter-repo
4. **Use worktrees instead of multiple clones** to save disk space
5. **Regularly prune your reflog** to keep it manageable
6. **Document complex Git operations** for your team
7. **Test your Git scripts** in a safe environment first
