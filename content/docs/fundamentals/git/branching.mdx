# Git Branching

Branches in Git allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation without affecting the main codebase. They are lightweight, easy to create, and can be merged back into the main branch when ready.

## Creating Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch feature-login

# Create and switch to a new branch in one command
git checkout -b feature-login

# Using the newer switch command (Git 2.23+)
git switch -c feature-login
```

## Switching Between Branches

```bash
# Using checkout (traditional)
git checkout main
git checkout feature-login

# Using switch (Git 2.23+)
git switch main
git switch feature-login
```

## Listing Branches

```bash
# List local branches
git branch

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# List remote branches
git branch -r

# List branches with more information
git branch -v
```

## Deleting Branches

```bash
# Delete a fully merged branch
git branch -d feature-done

# Force delete a branch (even if not merged)
git branch -D feature-abandoned
```

## Renaming Branches

```bash
# Rename the current branch
git branch -m new-branch-name

# Rename a specific branch
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

## Merging Branches

When your work on a branch is complete, you can merge it back into another branch (typically the main branch):

```bash
# Switch to the target branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch into the current branch
git merge feature-login
```

### Fast-Forward vs. Non-Fast-Forward Merges

```bash
# Fast-forward merge (when possible)
git merge feature-branch

# Create a merge commit even if fast-forward is possible
git merge --no-ff feature-branch

# Squash all commits from the branch into one
git merge --squash feature-branch
```

## Handling Merge Conflicts

When Git can't automatically merge changes, you'll need to resolve conflicts manually:

1. Git will mark the conflicts in the affected files
2. Edit the files to resolve the conflicts
3. Stage the resolved files
4. Complete the merge with a commit

```bash
# After resolving conflicts
git add resolved-file.js
git commit -m "Merge feature-login branch, resolving conflicts"
```

## Branch Management Strategies

### Feature Branch Workflow

1. Create a branch for each feature or bug fix
2. Work on the branch until the feature is complete
3. Merge back into the main branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature-user-profiles
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement user profiles"
git checkout main
git merge feature-user-profiles
```

### Git Flow

A more structured workflow with specific branch types:

- `main` - production code
- `develop` - development code
- `feature/*` - new features
- `release/*` - preparing for a release
- `hotfix/*` - urgent fixes for production

```bash
# Start a feature
git checkout -b feature/user-profiles develop

# Finish a feature
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-profiles
git branch -d feature/user-profiles
```

## Remote Branches

```bash
# Push a local branch to remote
git push -u origin feature-branch

# Track a remote branch
git checkout --track origin/feature-branch

# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Creating a feature branch and merging it

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature-search

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add search functionality"

# Switch back to main and merge
git checkout main
git merge feature-search

# Delete the feature branch after successful merge
git branch -d feature-search
```

### Example 2: Working on multiple features simultaneously

```bash
# Start working on feature 1
git checkout -b feature-login
# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form"

# Switch to work on feature 2
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature-signup
# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add signup form"

# Go back to feature 1 to continue work
git checkout feature-login
```

### Example 3: Handling a hotfix while working on a feature

```bash
# Currently working on a feature
git checkout -b feature-dashboard
# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add dashboard layout"

# Critical bug found in production
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix-login-bug

# Fix the bug
git add auth.js
git commit -m "Fix login authentication bug"

# Merge hotfix to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix-login-bug

# Return to feature work
git checkout feature-dashboard

# Eventually, get the hotfix into your feature branch
git merge main
```
