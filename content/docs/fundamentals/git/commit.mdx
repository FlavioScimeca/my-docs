# Git Commit

Commits are the fundamental building blocks in Git. A commit represents a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, including all tracked files and their contents.

## Basic Commit

The most basic way to create a commit is:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

This will commit all changes that have been staged using `git add`.

## Staging and Committing

Before you can commit, you need to stage your changes:

```bash
# Stage specific files
git add file1.js file2.js

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Stage changes to tracked files only (ignores new files)
git add -u

# Stage portions of files interactively
git add -p
```

Then commit the staged changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new features to the login system"
```

## Writing Good Commit Messages

A good commit message should:

1. Start with a concise summary (50 characters or less)
2. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
3. Explain what and why, not how

For more detailed messages, use the extended description:

```bash
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature" -m "This implements JWT-based authentication with password hashing and session management to improve security."
```

Or omit the `-m` flag to open your default editor for a multi-line message:

```bash
git commit
```

```
# Example of a good commit message format:
Add user authentication feature

- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add password hashing with bcrypt
- Create session management system

This improves security by replacing the old cookie-based auth.
```

## Committing All Changes

To stage and commit all changes in one command:

```bash
git commit -a -m "Fix all linting errors"
```

Note: This only works for modified files that are already tracked. New files still need to be added with `git add`.

## Amending Commits

If you need to modify your most recent commit:

```bash
# Make your changes, then stage them
git add .

# Amend the previous commit
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

# Keep the previous commit message
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

Warning: Don't amend commits that have been pushed to a shared repository unless you're absolutely sure no one has based work on them.

## Viewing Commit History

```bash
# View commit history
git log

# View compact history
git log --oneline

# View history with changes
git log -p

# View history with stats
git log --stat

# View graphical representation
git log --graph --oneline --all
```

## Referencing Commits

You can reference commits in various ways:

```bash
# By full SHA-1 hash
git show 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j

# By abbreviated hash (at least 7 characters)
git show 1a2b3c4

# By relative references
git show HEAD        # Latest commit
git show HEAD~1      # Second latest commit
git show HEAD~2      # Third latest commit
git show master~3    # Third commit before master
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Fixing a typo in your code

```bash
# Edit the file to fix the typo
git add file-with-typo.js
git commit -m "Fix typo in login error message"
```

### Example 2: Adding a new feature with multiple files

```bash
git add src/components/Button.js
git add src/styles/button.css
git add src/utils/buttonHelpers.js
git commit -m "Add new Button component with animations"
```

### Example 3: Amending a commit that's missing a file

```bash
# Oops, forgot to include a file in the last commit
git add forgotten-file.js
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### Example 4: Creating a detailed commit for a significant change

```bash
git add .
git commit
```

Then in the editor:

```
Implement user authentication system

- Add login/signup forms
- Create JWT token generation
- Add password hashing with bcrypt
- Implement protected routes

This change provides secure authentication for users
and restricts access to protected content.
```
