# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and maintain different versions of their projects.

## Basic Concepts

- **Repository**: A storage location for your project, containing all files and their history
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository that allows you to work on features without affecting the main codebase
- **Remote**: A version of your repository hosted on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a remote repository
- **Pull**: Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository
- **Push**: Sending your local changes to a remote repository

## Essential Commands

### Setup and Configuration

```bash
# Configure your identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Initialize a new repository
git init
```

### Basic Workflow

```bash
# Check status of your repository
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add <filename>
git add .  # Add all files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

# View commit history
git log
```

### Working with Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch <branch-name>

# Switch to a branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>

# Merge a branch into your current branch
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Remote Operations

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Add a remote
git remote add origin <repository-url>

# Fetch changes from remote
git fetch

# Pull changes from remote
git pull origin <branch-name>

# Push changes to remote
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write meaningful commit messages** that clearly describe what changes were made
2. **Commit often** to create smaller, more manageable changes
3. **Use branches** for new features or bug fixes
4. **Pull before pushing** to avoid merge conflicts
5. **Use .gitignore** to exclude files that shouldn't be tracked (build artifacts, dependencies, etc.)

## Advanced Topics

- **Rebasing**: Reapplying commits on top of another base
- **Cherry-picking**: Applying specific commits from one branch to another
- **Stashing**: Temporarily storing changes without committing
- **Git hooks**: Scripts that run automatically on certain Git events
- **Git workflows**: Strategies for organizing branches and collaboration (like Git Flow, GitHub Flow)
