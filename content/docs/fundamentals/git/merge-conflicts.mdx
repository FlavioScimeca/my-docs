# Git Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git can't automatically combine changes from different branches. This typically happens when two branches have modified the same part of a file, or when one branch has modified a file that another branch has deleted.

## Understanding Merge Conflicts

When Git encounters a conflict, it will mark the conflicted areas in your files and pause the merge process, allowing you to resolve the conflicts manually.

A conflict-marked file looks like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the content from the current branch (HEAD)
=======
This is the content from the branch you're merging in
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

The content between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is from your current branch, and the content between `=======` and `>>>>>>> feature-branch` is from the branch you're trying to merge.

## When Conflicts Occur

Conflicts commonly happen during these operations:

- Merging branches (`git merge`)
- Rebasing (`git rebase`)
- Cherry-picking (`git cherry-pick`)
- Pulling changes (`git pull`)
- Applying stashes (`git stash apply`)

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

### Step 1: Identify Conflicted Files

When a conflict occurs, Git will tell you which files have conflicts:

```bash
# During a merge
Auto-merging src/app.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/app.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

You can also list conflicted files with:

```bash
git status
```

### Step 2: Understand the Conflict

Open the conflicted files in your editor and look for the conflict markers:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
=======
const greeting = "Hi, everyone!";
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```

### Step 3: Resolve the Conflict

Edit the file to remove the conflict markers and choose the correct content. You might:

- Keep one version
- Keep the other version
- Combine both versions
- Write something completely different

For example, a resolved conflict might look like:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Hello, everyone!';
```

### Step 4: Mark as Resolved

After editing, mark the file as resolved:

```bash
git add src/app.js
```

### Step 5: Complete the Merge

Once all conflicts are resolved and marked as such:

```bash
# For a merge
git merge --continue
# Or simply
git commit

# For a rebase
git rebase --continue

# For a cherry-pick
git cherry-pick --continue
```

## Tools for Resolving Conflicts

### Command Line

```bash
# Show the current conflicts
git diff

# Use a merge tool
git mergetool
```

### Visual Tools

Many editors and IDEs have built-in conflict resolution tools:

- VS Code
- IntelliJ/WebStorm
- Sublime Merge
- GitKraken

## Strategies to Avoid Conflicts

1. **Pull frequently** to stay up-to-date with remote changes
2. **Use smaller, focused commits** that are easier to merge
3. **Communicate with your team** about who is working on which files
4. **Use feature branches** to isolate work
5. **Structure your codebase** to minimize overlap between features

## Advanced Conflict Resolution

### Aborting a Merge

If you want to cancel a merge with conflicts:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

### Using `--ours` or `--theirs`

For binary files or when you know which version to keep:

```bash
# Keep the version from the current branch
git checkout --ours path/to/file

# Keep the version from the branch being merged
git checkout --theirs path/to/file

# Don't forget to mark as resolved
git add path/to/file
```

### Resolving Multiple Conflicts

When dealing with many conflicts:

```bash
# List all conflicted files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# Resolve each file one by one
git checkout --ours path/to/file1
git add path/to/file1

git checkout --theirs path/to/file2
git add path/to/file2

# For files that need manual resolution
# Edit the file, then:
git add path/to/file3
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Basic Merge Conflict Resolution

```bash
# Start a merge that results in conflicts
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch

# See which files have conflicts
git status

# Open and edit the conflicted file
# After resolving the conflict:
git add resolved-file.js
git commit -m "Merge feature-branch, resolving conflicts in login functionality"
```

### Example 2: Resolving Conflicts During Rebase

```bash
# Start a rebase that results in conflicts
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main

# Resolve conflicts in the current commit
# Edit the conflicted files
git add resolved-file.js
git rebase --continue

# If more conflicts appear in the next commit, repeat the process
```

### Example 3: Using a Merge Tool

```bash
# Configure your preferred merge tool
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'

# When you have conflicts
git mergetool

# After resolving all conflicts
git commit
```

### Example 4: Resolving Conflicts with Different Strategies

```bash
# Keep "our" version for specific files
git checkout --ours config.json
git add config.json

# Keep "their" version for other files
git checkout --theirs package.json
git add package.json

# Manually resolve the rest
# Edit app.js to resolve conflicts
git add app.js

# Complete the merge
git commit
```

## Best Practices

1. **Understand both changes** before resolving conflicts
2. **Test your code** after resolving conflicts to ensure it still works
3. **Communicate with the author** of the other changes if you're unsure
4. **Use meaningful commit messages** when completing conflict resolution
5. **Consider rebasing instead of merging** for cleaner history
