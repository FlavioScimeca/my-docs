# Git Rebase

Rebasing is a powerful Git feature that allows you to reapply commits on top of another base commit. Unlike merging, which creates a new commit that combines changes from two branches, rebasing moves or combines a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

## Basic Rebasing

The basic syntax for rebasing is:

```bash
# While on your feature branch
git rebase main
```

This will:

1. Temporarily save changes from your feature branch
2. Move your feature branch to the tip of the main branch
3. Reapply your changes one by one

## When to Use Rebase

- **For a cleaner history**: Rebasing creates a linear project history
- **Before submitting a pull request**: To incorporate latest changes from the target branch
- **For local cleanup**: To clean up your local commits before sharing

## When Not to Use Rebase

- **On public/shared branches**: Never rebase commits that have been pushed and others might have based work on
- **When you want to preserve the branch history**: Merging preserves the complete history and chronological order

## Interactive Rebasing

Interactive rebasing gives you complete control over your commit history:

```bash
# Rebase the last 3 commits interactively
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This opens an editor with options for each commit:

```
pick f7f3f6d Add feature A
pick 310154e Fix typo in feature A
pick a5f4a0d Implement feature B

# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
```

You can change the order of commits or modify them using the available commands.

## Common Interactive Rebase Operations

### Squashing Commits

Combine multiple commits into one:

```bash
# In the interactive rebase editor
pick f7f3f6d Add feature A
squash 310154e Fix typo in feature A
pick a5f4a0d Implement feature B
```

This will combine the first two commits into one.

### Rewording Commit Messages

Change commit messages:

```bash
# In the interactive rebase editor
pick f7f3f6d Add feature A
reword 310154e Fix typo in feature A
pick a5f4a0d Implement feature B
```

This will prompt you to edit the commit message for the second commit.

### Editing Commits

Make changes to specific commits:

```bash
# In the interactive rebase editor
pick f7f3f6d Add feature A
edit 310154e Fix typo in feature A
pick a5f4a0d Implement feature B
```

Git will stop at the "edit" commit, allowing you to make changes:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit --amend
# Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue
```

### Dropping Commits

Remove commits entirely:

```bash
# In the interactive rebase editor
pick f7f3f6d Add feature A
drop 310154e Fix typo in feature A
pick a5f4a0d Implement feature B
```

## Handling Rebase Conflicts

When rebasing, you might encounter conflicts:

```bash
# During a rebase with conflicts
# 1. Fix the conflicts in the files
git add resolved-file.js
# 2. Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue

# Or abort the rebase entirely
git rebase --abort
```

## Rebasing onto Different Branches

You can rebase onto any branch or commit:

```bash
# Rebase current branch onto a specific branch
git rebase target-branch

# Rebase a specific branch onto another
git rebase target-branch source-branch

# Rebase onto a specific commit
git rebase a1b2c3d4
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Cleaning up local commits before pushing

```bash
# You've made several small commits locally
git log --oneline
# a5f4a0d Add validation
# 310154e Fix typo in validation
# f7f3f6d Add form field

# Clean them up before pushing
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor, change to:
pick f7f3f6d Add form field
squash 310154e Fix typo in validation
squash a5f4a0d Add validation

# Write a new combined commit message
# "Add form field with validation"
```

### Example 2: Incorporating upstream changes

```bash
# Update your local copy of the main branch
git checkout main
git pull

# Rebase your feature branch on the updated main
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them
# git add resolved-files
# git rebase --continue

# Push your rebased branch (requires force push if already pushed)
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Example 3: Moving a branch to a different base

```bash
# You created a branch from the wrong starting point
git checkout wrong-base-branch
git checkout -b feature-branch
# ... make some commits ...

# Later, you realize you should have branched from main
git rebase --onto main wrong-base-branch feature-branch
```

### Example 4: Splitting a commit

```bash
# Start an interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Mark the commit you want to split with "edit"
# When Git stops at that commit:
git reset HEAD^  # Undo the commit but keep changes staged

# Now create multiple commits
git add file1.js
git commit -m "First part of the feature"
git add file2.js
git commit -m "Second part of the feature"

# Continue the rebase
git rebase --continue
```

## Best Practices

1. **Never rebase public branches** that others might be working on
2. **Use `--force-with-lease`** instead of `--force` when pushing rebased branches
3. **Communicate with your team** when rebasing shared branches
4. **Keep rebases small and focused** to minimize conflicts
5. **Test after rebasing** to ensure everything still works
