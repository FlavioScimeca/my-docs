# Git Stash

Git stash allows you to temporarily save changes you've made to your working directory without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch branches or pull updates but aren't ready to commit your current work.

## Basic Stashing

```bash
# Stash your changes
git stash

# Same as above but with a custom message
git stash save "Work in progress for feature X"
```

When you run `git stash`, Git:

1. Takes all modified tracked files
2. Saves them on a stack of unfinished changes
3. Reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit

## Viewing Stashes

```bash
# List all stashes
git stash list

# Example output:
# stash@{0}: WIP on feature-branch: abc1234 Add login form
# stash@{1}: On main: Work in progress for feature X
```

## Applying Stashes

```bash
# Apply the most recent stash (stash@{0})
git stash apply

# Apply a specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Apply the most recent stash and remove it from the stash list
git stash pop

# Apply a specific stash and remove it
git stash pop stash@{2}
```

## Viewing Stash Contents

```bash
# Show the changes in the most recent stash
git stash show

# Show the changes with diff details
git stash show -p

# Show changes in a specific stash
git stash show stash@{1}
git stash show -p stash@{1}
```

## Managing Stashes

```bash
# Remove the most recent stash
git stash drop

# Remove a specific stash
git stash drop stash@{2}

# Clear all stashes
git stash clear
```

## Partial Stashing

You can stash specific files or changes:

```bash
# Stash only specific files
git stash push path/to/file1.js path/to/file2.js

# Stash with interactive selection of hunks
git stash -p
```

## Creating a Branch from a Stash

If you want to apply a stash to a new branch:

```bash
# Create a new branch from a stash and apply the stash to it
git stash branch new-branch-name stash@{1}
```

This:

1. Creates a new branch
2. Checks out the commit you were on when you stashed
3. Applies the stash changes
4. Drops the stash if successful

## Stashing Untracked Files

By default, `git stash` only stashes tracked files that have been modified. To include untracked files:

```bash
# Stash including untracked files
git stash -u
# or
git stash --include-untracked

# Stash including both untracked and ignored files
git stash -a
# or
git stash --all
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Switching branches with uncommitted work

```bash
# You're working on feature-branch but need to fix something on main
# Stash your current changes
git stash save "WIP: Feature branch implementation"

# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Make your fix
git add fixed-file.js
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"

# Return to your feature branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Apply your stashed changes
git stash pop
```

### Example 2: Pulling updates without committing current work

```bash
# You have local changes but need to pull latest updates
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

### Example 3: Selectively stashing and applying changes

```bash
# Interactively choose which changes to stash
git stash -p

# Later, apply the stash and see what's in it
git stash show -p
git stash pop
```

### Example 4: Managing multiple stashes for different features

```bash
# Working on feature A
git stash save "Feature A: Implemented user authentication"

# Working on feature B
git stash save "Feature B: Added payment processing"

# List stashes
git stash list
# stash@{0}: On feature-b: Feature B: Added payment processing
# stash@{1}: On feature-a: Feature A: Implemented user authentication

# Apply feature A stash to continue working on it
git checkout feature-a
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

### Example 5: Creating a branch for a complex stashed change

```bash
# You stashed some complex changes but now want to work on them in isolation
git stash list
# stash@{0}: WIP on main: Complex refactoring of auth system

# Create a dedicated branch for this work
git stash branch auth-refactoring stash@{0}
```
