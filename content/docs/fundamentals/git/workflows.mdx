# Git Workflows

Git workflows are structured approaches to using Git for collaboration and development. They define how code moves from development to production and how team members collaborate on changes.

## Why Use a Workflow?

A well-defined Git workflow:

- Provides consistency across the team
- Reduces merge conflicts
- Makes releases more predictable
- Improves code quality
- Simplifies onboarding new team members

## Common Git Workflows

### 1. Centralized Workflow

The simplest approach, similar to SVN but with Git's distributed features.

#### How It Works

- Single `main` branch
- Everyone pulls and pushes to `main`
- Conflicts are resolved locally before pushing

#### Example

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/company/project.git

# Make changes
# ...

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts
# ...

# Push changes
git push origin main
```

#### Best For

- Small teams
- Simple projects
- Teams transitioning from SVN

#### Limitations

- No isolation for new features
- Higher risk of breaking the main branch
- Difficult to have work-in-progress

### 2. Feature Branch Workflow

Each feature is developed in its own branch, then merged back to `main`.

#### How It Works

- `main` branch contains stable code
- New features are developed in feature branches
- Pull requests/merge requests are used for code review
- After approval, feature branches are merged into `main`

#### Example

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement user login"

# Push feature branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication

# Create a pull request (on GitHub/GitLab/etc.)
# After approval:

# Update main
git checkout main
git pull

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/user-authentication

# Push the updated main
git push origin main

# Delete the feature branch
git branch -d feature/user-authentication
git push origin --delete feature/user-authentication
```

#### Best For

- Most teams
- Collaborative projects
- Projects requiring code review

### 3. Gitflow Workflow

A robust framework for managing larger projects with scheduled releases.

#### How It Works

- Two main branches: `main` and `develop`
- `main` always reflects production-ready state
- `develop` contains latest delivered development changes
- Feature branches branch off from `develop`
- Release branches branch off from `develop`
- Hotfix branches branch off from `main`

#### Branch Types

- **Feature branches**: New features (`feature/...`)
- **Release branches**: Preparing for a release (`release/...`)
- **Hotfix branches**: Urgent fixes for production (`hotfix/...`)
- **Develop**: Integration branch for features
- **Main**: Production code only

#### Example

```bash
# Starting a feature
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart

# Completing a feature
git checkout develop
git pull
git merge feature/shopping-cart
git push origin develop

# Creating a release
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b release/1.0.0
# Make release-specific changes (version numbers, etc.)
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.0.0"

# Finishing a release
git checkout main
git pull
git merge release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0

git checkout develop
git pull
git merge release/1.0.0
git push origin develop

git branch -d release/1.0.0

# Creating a hotfix
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1

# Finishing a hotfix
git checkout main
git pull
git merge hotfix/1.0.1
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Version 1.0.1"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.1

git checkout develop
git pull
git merge hotfix/1.0.1
git push origin develop

git branch -d hotfix/1.0.1
```

#### Best For

- Larger teams
- Projects with scheduled releases
- Products with multiple versions in production

#### Limitations

- Complex for small projects
- Overhead for simple changes
- Can lead to long-lived branches

### 4. GitHub Flow

A simpler alternative to Gitflow, focused on continuous delivery.

#### How It Works

- `main` branch is always deployable
- Branch off from `main` for new work
- Commit regularly to your branch
- Open a pull request for discussion
- Merge to `main` after approval
- Deploy immediately after merging to `main`

#### Example

```bash
# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature-user-profiles

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile page"

# Push branch and create PR
git push -u origin feature-user-profiles

# After approval and merge, pull the updated main
git checkout main
git pull
```

#### Best For

- Continuous deployment environments
- Web applications
- Teams with good automated testing

### 5. Trunk-Based Development

A development practice where all developers work on a single branch with frequent commits.

#### How It Works

- Short-lived feature branches (1-2 days max)
- Frequent merges to the trunk (`main`)
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Emphasis on automated testing and CI/CD

#### Example

```bash
# Start work on a small feature
git checkout -b small-feature

# Complete work quickly (within a day)
git add .
git commit -m "Add sorting to product list"

# Pull latest changes from main
git pull origin main

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin small-feature

# After quick review, merge to main
# Delete the branch after merging
```

#### Best For

- Experienced teams
- Projects with strong CI/CD
- Teams practicing DevOps

## Choosing a Workflow

Consider these factors when choosing a workflow:

1. **Team size and experience**
2. **Project complexity**
3. **Release frequency**
4. **Need for multiple versions**
5. **CI/CD capabilities**

## Implementing Workflows with Tools

### GitHub/GitLab Features

- **Branch protection rules**: Prevent direct pushes to important branches
- **Required reviews**: Enforce code review before merging
- **Status checks**: Require CI tests to pass before merging
- **Merge options**: Choose between merge commits, squash merging, or rebasing

Example GitHub branch protection:

```
Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules > Add rule:
- Branch name pattern: main
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Include administrators
- Restrict who can push to matching branches
```

### Automation Tools

- **Git hooks**: Enforce workflow rules locally
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment
- **Bots**: Automate routine tasks like labeling PRs

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Setting Up Gitflow

```bash
# Install gitflow (on macOS)
brew install git-flow

# Initialize gitflow in a repository
git flow init

# Accept the defaults or customize branch names

# Start a feature
git flow feature start user-authentication

# Finish a feature
git flow feature finish user-authentication

# Start a release
git flow release start 1.0.0

# Finish a release
git flow release finish 1.0.0
```

### Example 2: Implementing GitHub Flow with Protected Branches

1. In GitHub repository settings, protect the `main` branch:

   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

2. Workflow for developers:

```bash
# Create a branch for a new feature
git checkout -b feature-x

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature-x

# Address review feedback
git add .
git commit -m "Address feedback"
git push

# After merge, clean up
git checkout main
git pull
git branch -d feature-x
```

### Example 3: Trunk-Based Development with Feature Flags

```bash
# Create a short-lived branch
git checkout -b add-search-feature

# Add feature behind a flag
# In code:
if (FEATURES.enableSearch) {
  // New search functionality
}

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add search feature behind feature flag"
git push -u origin add-search-feature

# After quick review and merge, enable the feature in production
# by changing the feature flag configuration
```

## Best Practices

1. **Document your workflow** for the team
2. **Automate as much as possible** with CI/CD
3. **Keep branches short-lived** to minimize merge conflicts
4. **Use meaningful branch names** and commit messages
5. **Regularly clean up merged branches**
6. **Consider using merge squashing** for cleaner history
7. **Enforce workflow rules** with branch protection
8. **Adapt the workflow** as your team and project evolve
