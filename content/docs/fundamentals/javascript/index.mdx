# JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language that powers the interactive web. Originally designed as a scripting language for browsers, it has evolved into a robust language for both frontend and backend development.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It's a multi-paradigm language that supports:

- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming
- Event-driven programming
- Imperative programming

JavaScript runs in browsers, on servers (via Node.js), in mobile applications, IoT devices, and more.

## JavaScript Evolution

JavaScript has evolved significantly since its creation:

- **ES5 (ECMAScript 5)**: Released in 2009, introduced strict mode, JSON support, and array methods
- **ES6/ES2015**: Major update with arrow functions, classes, modules, promises, and more
- **ES2016-ES2023**: Annual releases with incremental improvements and new features
